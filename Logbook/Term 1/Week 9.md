#### 12:39
- Beginning to edit my Literature review to reduce the length in order to get it within the page limit. 

#### 14:18
- I have edited the section on String Gas Cosmology to correct it for some mistakes that I made. 

#### 15:10
- I have written the abstract for the lit review. 

#### 17:32
- I have added some extra references for the sections and rewritten some of the Cosmic inflation to improve the readability. 
- Sent the first draft to Kostas.

- I realised my mistake on the previous attempt. I did not compute the summation properly. I realised that I was misunderstanding what was being summed over, so I will make note of the different equations using more formalised notation so that I do not forget again.  
- This gives the F-term potential in the form $$ \begin{align} V_F &= e^K ((\partial_iW + W\partial_iK)g^{ij^*} (\partial_jW + W\partial_jK)^* - 3|W|^2) \\& = e^K(g^{ij^*}D_iW (D_jW)^* - 3|W|^2), \quad D_iW = \partial_iW + W\partial_iK \end{align}$$ so for the above I need to sum over each of the different superfields in K.
- For the kinetic Lagrangian $$ \mathcal{L}_{kin} = K_{ij^*} \partial_{\mu} \phi^i \partial^{\mu} {\phi^*}^{j^*}  $$

- I have reattempted the derivation using the Kahler potential $$ K = -3\alpha \ln\left(1 - Z\overline{Z} - S\overline{S} \right)$$ though it is not quite finished yet.

- I have attempted to derive a generalised version of the SUGRA $V_F$ however, I think I may have made a mistake as applying the limit of $m_p \rightarrow \infty$, I think leads to indeterminacy. This may be a mistake as I did not include the $m_p$ originally which I will do in the future, though I am unsure of if it would be a coefficient for $Z$ and $S$ in a similar way to in the Poncaire disk potential

- I will attempt this again including the $m_p$ term explicitly, to see if I made a mistake.

#### 16:55
- Added a section on VSL to my literature review and I will now add a section on the Ekroptic scenario. 

#### 17:49
- Completed the section on the Ekroptic scenario. 
- I will try to find some figures for the Horizon and Flatness Problems. 

#### 18:50
- Added a figure for the Horizon Problem, the one from the Tasi Inflation notes
- The figure for the Flatness Problem I screenshotted from Introduction to Inflation and dark energy by Kostas but the quality of the screenshot is not great so I will try to find a better one.

#### 15:20
- I have edited and reduced the sections on String gas cosmology and Matter bounce to reduce them in their length. I now have about a page to cut down as I am at 11 pages with the extra figures. 
- I think that I will reduce the introduction section a bit and the cosmic inflation section as I think they could be reduced without causing problems.
