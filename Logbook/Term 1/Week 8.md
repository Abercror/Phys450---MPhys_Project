- I need to add a designated section to my literature review to discuss the Tensor ratio and spectral index, how it forms and why it is important. This is because inflation solves the Horizon and the flatness problems but slow-roll inflation aligns with the observational values for the tensor ratio and the spectral index <1. 

#### 14:24
- Added to my section on how inflation solves the Horizon and the Flatness problems. 

#### 19:01
- Reading the papers from the references of "On the Present Status of Inflationary Cosmology" to find other Kahler potentials that I could explore and recreate the calculations

- Attempted to derived the kinetic Lagrangian for the Kahler Potential $$ K = -3\alpha \ln (T + \overline{T})$$ however, I realise that I made a mistake and I tried to do it for Cartesian coordinates. I will reattempt this tomorrow to correct the mistakes that I made.

#### 12:29
- I have written a small section outlining what Starobinsky inflation is showing the additional $R^2$ term in the Lagrangian as well as the potential. I need to add to it describing its successes and recent tension with the Atacama observations

#### 14:32
- Made another mistake during my attempt at deriving the Kinetic lagrangian but I will attempt again and not try to put $T$ in terms of $Z$

#### 15:12
- I have derived the kinetic Lagrangian for the previously mentioned Kahler potential and transformed it into the non-canonical scalar field term.
