- I need to add a designated section to my literature review to discuss the Tensor ratio and spectral index, how it forms and why it is important. This is because inflation solves the Horizon and the flatness problems but slow-roll inflation aligns with the observational values for the tensor ratio and the spectral index <1. 

#### 14:24
- Added to my section on how inflation solves the Horizon and the Flatness problems. 

#### 19:01
- Reading the papers from the references of "On the Present Status of Inflationary Cosmology" to find other Kahler potentials that I could explore and recreate the calculations

#### 18:02
- Attempted to derived the kinetic Lagrangian for the Kahler Potential $$ K = -3\alpha \ln (T + \overline{T})$$ however, I realise that I made a mistake and I tried to do it for Cartesian coordinates. I will reattempt this tomorrow to correct the mistakes that I made.

#### 12:29
- I have written a small section outlining what Starobinsky inflation is showing the additional $R^2$ term in the Lagrangian as well as the potential. I need to add to it describing its successes and recent tension with the Atacama observations

#### 14:32
- Made another mistake during my attempt at deriving the Kinetic lagrangian but I will attempt again and not try to put $T$ in terms of $Z$
![[Term 1/Derivations/Beyond/(2) Kahler potential derivation.png]]

#### 15:12
- I have derived the kinetic Lagrangian for the previously mentioned Kahler potential and transformed it into the non-canonical scalar field term. 
![[Term 1/Derivations/Beyond/(3) Kahler potential derivation.png]]
- I am not sure if I did it fully correct or if I should have not substituted $T$ for $\varphi$ before canonically normalising. 
- I recovered the equation for $\varphi$ from the booklet (using the notation of $m_p = 1$) which is good as the Kahler potential that I used for this was simply a rewriting of the other potential that I used from the booklet in a half-disk coordinate system. 
#### 23:22
- Reading in [Introduction to supergravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3502) I found this for a superpotential 
	- MSSM $$ W = \mu H_uH_d + y_uH_uQU^C + y_dH_dQD^C + y_lH_dLE^C$$ 
- The minimal superpotential is obtained by coupling the MSSM with $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supergravity, chiral superfields plus guage superfields. 

#### 23:58
- For the Kahler potential used the superpotental is set to 0 and with $3\alpha = 1$, when associating the posonic model with $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supergravity $$ K = -3\alpha \log \left( T + \overline{T} \right), \quad W = 0$$
- I am not sure if another superpotential can be used with this Kahler potential or if that cannot be used. I am not sure if the combining of a Kahler potential and a superpotential can be done arbitrarily or if a link between them is required.

#### 00:27
- Looking at section 9 in [Escher in the Sky](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.06785) I think I will look into the Kahler potential with the superpotential $$K = -3\alpha \ln(1 - Z\overline{Z} - S\overline{S}), \quad W = A(Z) + SB(Z)$$ where S is an additional chiral superfield. I will attempt to derive the F-term potential for this Kahler potential and superpotential $$ V_F = e^K \sum_{Z, \overline{Z}} \left( \left(W_Z + W K_Z \right)K^{Z \overline{Z}} \left(W_{\overline{Z}} + WK_{\overline{Z}} \right) -3 |W|^2 \right)  $$ in order to investigate potential models akin to the E-model and T-model. The paper also mentions other superpotentials that I can look into later.

#### 12:29
- Completed the section on $\alpha$-attractors and I will now work on the section of the problems of inflationary cosmology and write about the alternatives to inflation within that section. The 2 alternatives that I will briefly touch upon will be String Gas cosmology and Matter bounce. 

#### 14:43
- Completed the first draft of the sections on String Gas cosmology and Matter bounce as well as my first draft of the conclusion though I will need to add to it. 
- For the String Gas cosmology section I am a little unsure of how much to include and how much explanation is required. As it will need to be understood by a wide audience and so I don't know how much explanation is required into things such as toroids, string dualities and dimensional compactification. 
- I now need to go back over the previous sections and add in more about the spectral index and tensor ratio and make it clear that slow-roll inflation is what solves this problem rather than cosmic inflation as a whole. I will also likely reorder the sections to allow for this to be more succinct. 


#### 17:49
- Added a section describing the density perturbations to the problems with the Hot Big Bang section
- Added to the description of Cosmic inflation to include the details of the tensor ratio and the spectral index that I will then build upon in the slow-roll inflation section. 

#### 19:35
- Completed the section describing how inflation solves the Flatness and Horizon Problems. I also added to the slow-roll inflation section to include the recasting of the tensor ratio and the spectral index using the slow-roll parameters. 


#### 21:20
- For the Kahler potential mentioned before $$K = -3\alpha \ln(1 - Z\overline{Z} - S\overline{S})$$ I found that the kinetic term is given by $$\mathcal{L}_{kin} = \frac{1 - S\overline{S}}{1 - Z\overline{Z} - S\overline{S}} \partial Z \partial\overline{Z}$$

### Monday, 1st December, 25
#### 10:43
-  I attempted to find the F-term potential for the Kahler potential and the superpotential $$ W = \mu S$$ however, I am a bit unsure if I did it correctly. In the paper section 9 eq (9.29) it says that S is a superfield that can be arranged to vanish during and after inflation. I am not sure how this vanishes whether it is a limit to 0 or the term just disappears. I think the sum is meant to be summing over all the superfields, i.e $S$ and $Z$, but I am not sure if I did that correctly or not. 
- I am meant to find that $$ V_F = \mu^2$$ and I don't as it does not cancel down to that. So I will need to comeback to this and reattempt this derivation.
