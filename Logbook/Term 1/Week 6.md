- Attempting to redo the derivation to find $\alpha$ for the E-model
#### 16:02
- Couldn't complete it so I will reattempt the derivations for the T-model instead
#### 18:13
- Completed the derivation of $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$ for the T-model

- Completed showing that the kinetic lagrangian can be found using the Kahler potential

#### 15:21
- Attempted to demonstrate the $\eta$-problem using the minimal Kahler potential. I read through the section about this in both the Tasi Lectures on inflation and Cosmic Inflation and Large scale structure but I am not sure how to derive it, so I will attempt another time.
