- Attempting to redo the derivation to find $\alpha$ for the E-model
#### 16:02
- Couldn't complete it so I will reattempt the derivations for the T-model instead
#### 18:13
- Completed the derivation of $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$ for the T-model

- I am not sure how I am meant to use the observational values of $V_0$ in order to find the value for $\alpha$ as I cannot figure this out. So I will move on to the next section and ask Kostas in the next meeting.
#### 13:53
- Completed showing that the kinetic lagrangian can be found using the Kahler potential

#### 15:21
- Attempted to demonstrate the $\eta$-problem using the minimal Kahler potential. I read through the section about this in both the Tasi Lectures on inflation and Cosmic Inflation and Large scale structure but I am not sure how to derive it, so I will attempt another time. 

### Thursday, 13th November

#### 11:39
- Beginning to write my literature review

#### 13:29
- Composed the contents page and begun to start the introduction

#### 16:17
- Written the start of my introduction though it could use some more work. I also configured my Zotero to automatically update my .bib file in for my references in my git repo on both my devices so my references will not be lost. 
- I have chosen to have my introduction section to be a bit of a history of cosmology post Einstein's publication of "The Foundation of The General Theory of Relativity", discussing Friedmann publishing his equations and the de Sitter / Einstein universe models. 
- Then I will have a key for each of the main variables used so that the reader may refer back if the get stuck. Next I will write a kind of mini lecture / crash course in cosmology so that the reader is acquainted with the basics of the topic before moving onto cosmology.

- This is just a preliminary contents page that I may change in the future, specifically I think I may remove the $\alpha$-attractors section as I don't think I will have enough space to write about it after covering the other topics as well. I will keep it as this for now but it is likely to change, as well as the section titles.

#### 12:31
- Starting to write the crash course section which will cover the basics of the different equations, relations and key variables. 

#### 18:12
- Completed my first draft of the crash course section. 

#### 19:01
- Completed showing the $\eta$-problem for the F-potential

![[Term 1/Derivations/9.3/(5) eta-problem.png]]
- I am unsure if this is completely correct. I think it is based off of the book Cosmological Inflation and Large-Scale Structure as when the potential and its derivative are evaluated at the origin the expression reduces to $\eta \approx 1$. The reason that this is known as the $\eta$-problem is that in order for slow-roll inflation to occur the condition $\eta \ll 1$ must be fulfilled and inflation ends when $|\eta |,\epsilon = 1$. For supergravity to be acceptable the inflaton mass must be very small, $$\eta = 1 + \frac{m_p ^2 \tilde{V}''}{\tilde{V}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{m_p^2 m_\varphi^2}{V} = 1 + \frac{m_p ^2 \tilde{V}''}{\tilde{V}},$$ in order to keep $\eta$ small.
