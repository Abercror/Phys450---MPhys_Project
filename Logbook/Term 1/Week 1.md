- Friedmann Equation
	- $$H(a)^2 = \frac{8 \pi  G}{3} \rho(t) - \frac{k c^2}{a(t)^2}$$
	- an equation that models the universe as a fluid with density $\rho(t)$ as solely a function of time like the scale factor, $a(t)$. It demonstrates that when $\rho \neq 0$ the universe is not static and states that the expansion rate is related to both the constituents of the universe as well as its shape, denoted by $k$ for the curvature. 

- Continuity Equation 
	- 	- $$\dot \rho + 3H\left( \rho + \frac{p}{c^2} \right) = 0$$
	- an equation that relates density of the universe to the pressure that it exerts, named the isotropic pressure $p(t)$. It assumes a constant mass for the universe and is also named the fluid equation. 

- Equation of state 
	- $$ p = \omega \rho c^2 $$
	- an equation describing a cosmologically perfect fluid that relates the isotropic pressure, $p(t)$, and the density parameter, $\rho(t)$. The two terms are related by the baratropic parameter, $\omega$, which is defined as  $$\omega = \frac{\Sigma_i p_i}{(\Sigma_i \rho_i) c^2} ,$$where $i$ denotes a different constituent of the universe. 
- Acceleration Equation 
	- $$ \frac{\ddot a}{a} = - \frac{4 \pi G}{3} \left( \rho + \frac{3 p}{c^2} \right) $$
	- a combination of the Friedmann equation and the continuity equation. Demonstrates that accelerated expansion of the universe requires, $\omega < -\frac{1}{3}$. []()
