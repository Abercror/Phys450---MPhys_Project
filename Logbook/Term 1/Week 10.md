- I am going to go over my literature review to check for errors and to try and remove some unnecessary sections so that I am within the page constraints. 
#### 18:24
- I have removed the section on the Matter Bounce hypothesis as it was the weakest of the 4 alternatives and was difficult to try and summarise in little space. I added a small paragraph introducing the alternatives and mentioned it as another possibility. 
- I also swapped the image for the Flatness Problem with one from the Phys265 lecture notes and it is much less blurry now.
- I been editing the first sections for spelling, and sentence structure issues making sure to define each symbol the first time I use it. 

#### 19:11
- I have fixed a lot of the spelling and punctuation errors throughout the paper. I now am over the page limit by just under half a page so I will need to either cut some more out or find a way to condense. 

#### 20:21
- After some re-configuring the layout a bit and removing some unnecessary sections I am within the page limit. 
- I will read through the whole document tomorrow to check if it all makes sense. 
- I need to sort out my logbook as well at some point, exporting all the different weeks to pdfs and then combining. I will need to make sure that all the images are visible and not cut in half by the page breaks and then combine the pdfs into 1.

#### 11:09
- Finished reading through my Literature review highlighting mistake and sentences that I need to change. 

#### 15:24
- Rewritten the section on slow-roll inflation to make it more understandable

#### 18:54
- Moved the density perturbation descriptions in the cosmic inflation section to the primordial density perturbation section to make it more consistent. 

### Friday, 12th December, 25
#### 01:14
- I have edited a lot of the Literature review. Most of the sections have been edited, reworded or rewritten. I have added back the Matter bounce section as I had saved space from cutting down on the previous sections. 

#### 09:44
- Corrected a few mistakes in the VSL and Ekpyrotic sections and edited the conclusion slightly for better readability and grammar. 
- Edited the first paragraph about solving the Horizon and Flatness problems to remove a phrasing error. 

#### 10:21
- Edited the introduction to be more accurate as I made a mistake by implying that the de Sitter model was proposed by Einstein and Willem de Sitter not just de Sitter. I have corrected the phrasing of that as well as a mistake near the end where I got the order of Guth and Starobinsky publishing wrong. 

#### 11:48
- Rewrote the captions for the figures of the Horizon and Flatness Problem to better explain the images and added a citation for the Phys265 lecture notes. 
- I also added the metric signature after the Einstein-Hilbert action equation for completeness

#### 12:15
- Corrected some missing square terms from the $\epsilon$ equation and the slow roll condition in one place

#### 12:52
- Added in the equations for the spectral index and tensor ratio for the Starobinsky model and the $\alpha$-attractor models
- Added a reference for the atacama telescope data and rewrote the paragraph

#### 13:14
- Made some tweaks to the Cosmic inflation section again around the existence of scalar fields and the discovery of the Higgs field. 

#### 13:24
- Fixed some awkward phrasing in the conclusion 

#### 14:10
- added some extra references in

#### 14:29
- Made a few final clarity changes
