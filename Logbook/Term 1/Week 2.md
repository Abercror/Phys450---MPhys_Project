#### 12:35
- Completed derivation of (38)

#### 17:49 
- Completed show that for (39) $$ \epsilon \ll 1 \leftrightarrow \rho_{kin} \ll V$$
#### 18:07
- Derived the expression (40) $$\epsilon = \frac{3}{2}(1 + w)$$
- The second slow-roll parameter $\eta$ is is defined by the expression $$\eta \equiv m^2_{p} \frac{V''}{V}$$ which when $|\eta| < 1$maintains that the fractional change of $\epsilon$ is small per e-fold. This is required as accelerated expansion will only be sustained for a long enough time period if the conversion of kinetic energy to potential energy is slow enough which required the condition $$ |\ddot{\phi} |\ll |V'|$$ 
#### 18:33
- Completed show that (41) and (42)

#### 22:39
- Creating and configuring the .tex file for my literature review

#### 23:43
- Set up the .tex file in vscode with the .bib file working. Configured the settings.json such that the latex recipe uses biber for the references rather than bibtex. 

#### 23:53
- Completed the configuration for the layout of the title page and contents page and added some preliminary section names in. Added comments to improve readability of the latex source file.
