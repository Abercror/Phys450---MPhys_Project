- I have looked over the feedback from Kostas on my previous logbook so correct and explain what I did not do before.

- I corrected the legend for the graph and the final values for the $N_* - 10$ curve were 
	- $n_s = 0.95496$
	- $r = 0.0075$
	- $q = 0.6868$
	- $N_* = 47.39 \approx 48$
- Starobinsky Inflation modelled where $N_* \rightarrow N_* - 10$, falls outside of the range of both the $68\%$ and $95\%$ meaning that, the model predicts that $N=50$ predicts a spectral index value that is too small. 
- The values of $V_0^{\frac{1}{4}}$ and $V_{end}^{\frac{1}{4}}$ are consistent with what is expected as values for the reheating temperature $T_R \sim 10^{15}$, and so the values $V_0^\frac{1}{4} = 7.98 \times 10^{15}$ for $q = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$ and the values on the figures below which range from $1.5 \times 10^{16} \lessapprox V_{end}^{\frac{1}{4}} \lessapprox 1.9 \times 10^{16}$ and $0.9 \times 10^{16} \lessapprox V_{0}^{\frac{1}{4}} \lessapprox 1.2 \times 10^{16}$ for $0.381 < q < 0.6868$

- I have read about the different options for part 9 of the project to see what direction I should take my project. I am leaning towards **9.3. $\alpha$-attractors** as it seems like an interesting direction to take my project.
- While reading Kostas' textbook "Introduction to Dark energy and Cosmic Inflation", he writes about the potential for the generation of solitons specifically mentioning Qballs and oscilons and that their formation is highly model dependent, but this axion dark matter candidate forms from a scalar field, and so would be the decay product of the inflatons in delayed reheating.
- Qballs require a complex Lagrangian in order to form and which based on reading through **9.3** it seems that the $\alpha$-attractors in supergravity allow for the complex Lagrangian. So I am wondering if it would be possible that an supergravity inflation model that allowed for delayed reheating could result in the formation of Qballs, which could contribute to dark matter.
- I created a Qball simulation ([Github](https://github.com/Abercror/QBall-simulation-Python.git)) in my free time over the weekend, that still contains a few bugs, based off of the document for John McDonald's project, so I am curious if it would be possible to determine the conditions required for Qball creation using that and then attempting to see if an inflation model could result in that.
