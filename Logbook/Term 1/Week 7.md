#### 18:23 
- I have written the section on the Horizon Problem and the Flatness problem for my literature review. 

#### 18:49
- Removed the Cosmological Key section from my literature review as I don't think it is necessary or worth the space.

- I have derived the equations for the E-model: $V_0 (\alpha)$, and $m(\alpha)$ which I will plot for fixed values of $N_*$ and $N_* - 10$ using $N_* = 60$ as the result from the Starobinsky model.

- The range of alpha will be constrained to $0 < \alpha < 5.83$ due to the relation $$ r = \frac{12 \alpha}{N_*^2} \quad \text{where} \quad r < 0.028 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \alpha < \frac{0.028 N_*^2}{12}$$ where for $N_* = 50 \; \alpha < 5.83$ and for $N_* = 60 \; \alpha < 8.4$. The range $0< \alpha < 5.83$ will be used to keep all of the results within the observational range.

#### 11:35
- Derived the equations for the T-model: which I will plot for the same $N_*$ values and $\alpha$ range.

#### 12:19
- The graphs are not what I expected them to be so I will take another look at the equations and try again

#### 13:38
- I have redone the equations for $V_0(\alpha)$ and $m(\alpha)$ using the approximation from the Starobinsky model of $e^{\frac{2}{\sqrt{6 \alpha}} \frac{\phi}{m_p}} \approx \frac{4N}{3 \alpha}$ and using the exponential forms of $\tanh x$ and $\sinh x$.

#### 14:20
- Using the newer equations I have derived graphs which look far more like what I would have expected.

- The 2 different models so that they have both different masses for the inflaton and different values for the potential, $V_0^{\frac{1}{4}}$, for the range of $\alpha$, but they have the same graph for the tensor ratio, $r$ against the spectral index, $n_s$, as they both reduce to the same relation. Only $r$ is dependent on $\alpha$, which is what causes these vertical lines in the graph.  
#### 16:52
- Added to my introduction section of my Literature review and I have also changed the contents page to simplify and reduce the number of sections. 

#### 18:47 
- Written some of the section on cosmic inflation describing what it is. I need to now write about primordial density perturbations and how they link to inflation and the reheating to form allow for the Hot Big Bang. 

### Saturday, 22nd November, 25
#### 03:19
- Written about the mathematical formulation of the inflaton scalar field describing the Klein-Gordon equation and leading up to the slow-roll approximation for the next section on slow-roll inflation. 

#### 18:29
- Completed the slow-roll inflation section describing the conditions for slow roll inflation to occur as well as the ending conditions for inflation. 


### Sunday, 23rd November, 25
#### 13:17 
- Starting on the section about how inflation solves the Horizon and the Flatness Problems

### Monday, 24th November, 25
#### 11:49
- Exporting log book to send to Kostas
