- I am going to try and figure out what is wrong with my code for the potential $$ V_F = \frac{\mu^2}{3\alpha} \left(1 - \tanh^2 \left(\frac{\phi}{\sqrt{6 \alpha} M_{pl}} \right) \right)^{1-3\alpha} = \frac{\mu^2}{3\alpha} \left(\cosh \left(\frac{\phi}{\sqrt{6 \alpha} M_{pl}} \right) \right)^{6\alpha-2} $$ though I am not sure if it is the value of $\mu$ as I could try and find that out using $A_s$, so I will try to determine the slow-roll parameters and $\phi_{end}$.

- I attempted to derive $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ for this potential to determine which would reach 1 first. $\eta$ would but it doesn't allow for an analytical solution to $\phi_{end}$ and using $\epsilon$ then doesn't work with with the function for $N_e$.

- When setting both $\mu, M_{pl} = 1$, the graph for $\alpha = 1$ is a quadratic potential. Though this does not have the required shape for slow roll inflation the minimum point would allow for a particle to exist.

- Using the same Kahler potential but with the superpotential $$W = \mu SZ$$ I derived the potential $$V_F = \frac{\mu^2}{3\alpha}\sinh^2\left(\frac{\phi}{\sqrt{6\alpha}M_{pl}}\right)\left(\cosh \left(\frac{\phi}{\sqrt{6\alpha} M_{pl}}\right)\right)^{6\alpha-4}$$

- Unlike the previous potential it does not flatten when setting $M_{pl} = 2.43 \times 10^{18}$ GeV and has the same potential well shape

- I derived the equations of motion for the inflaton having set a angle of rotation such that the axion is set to 0. Though in regards to the stabilisation of the axion I need to research further on what that means as I thought to be stabilised $$\frac{dV}{d\sigma} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad V = V(\varphi, \sigma)$$ as if $$ V(\varphi, \sigma) = V(\varphi)$$ then the potential is flat in the axion direction but I am not sure if that means it is stabilised

- I attempted to derive the slow roll parameters for this potential though I am not sure if I should since it has the same shape potential as the previous one which doesn't match with the inflaton slowly rolling down the potential and instead looks more like reheating.
