  abstract = {In a series of five lectures I review inflationary cosmology. I begin with a description of the initial conditions problems of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology and then explain how inflation, an early period of accelerated expansion, solves these problems. Next, I describe how inflation transforms microscopic quantum fluctuations into macroscopic seeds for cosmological structure formation. I present in full detail the famous calculation for the primordial spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations. I then define the inverse problem of extracting information on the inflationary era from observations of cosmic microwave background fluctuations. The current observational evidence for inflation and opportunities for future tests of inflation are discussed. Finally, I review the challenge of relating inflation to fundamental physics by giving an account of inflation in string theory.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$Λ\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$Λ\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$Ω\_c h\textasciicircum 2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$Ω\_b h\textasciicircum 2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$τ= 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100θ\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$Λ\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$Ω\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$σ\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$Λ\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_ν{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$Λ\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,σ\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$Λ\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

By fitting the complete \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM+\$r\$+\$n\_t\$ model with two different approaches for the tensor sector, we have not only established which method is the most reliable, but have also achieved the strongest constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in current literature: \$r{$<$}0.028\$ and \$-1.37 {$<$} n\_t {$<$} 0.42\$ at 95\% confidence level. Furthermore, our examination of the common signal detected by the NANOGrav Collaboration further confirms that a simple power-law cannot reconcile the constraints from different datasets if the NANOGrav detection is due to a primordial inflationary gravitational wave background, as previously shown in the literature.},

I will introduce the procedure of KK dimensional reduction and describe general supergravity theories, in particular the unique 11 dimensional supergravity. I will then exemplify the issues of KK dimensional reduction on the only complete example of full nonlinear compactification, on the gravitational space \$AdS\_7\textbackslash times S\textasciicircum 4\$.
