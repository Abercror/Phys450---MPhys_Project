  abstract = {In a series of five lectures I review inflationary cosmology. I begin with a description of the initial conditions problems of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology and then explain how inflation, an early period of accelerated expansion, solves these problems. Next, I describe how inflation transforms microscopic quantum fluctuations into macroscopic seeds for cosmological structure formation. I present in full detail the famous calculation for the primordial spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations. I then define the inverse problem of extracting information on the inflationary era from observations of cosmic microwave background fluctuations. The current observational evidence for inflation and opportunities for future tests of inflation are discussed. Finally, I review the challenge of relating inflation to fundamental physics by giving an account of inflation in string theory.},

  abstract = {We have taken a comprehensive approach to update the limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio (\$r\$) and the tensor spectral index (\$n\_t\$), using 10 datasets from the BICEP/Keck Array 2015 and 2018, Planck releases 3 and 4, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. By fitting the complete \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM+\$r\$+\$n\_t\$ model with two different approaches for the tensor sector, we have not only established which method is the most reliable, but have also achieved the strongest constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in current literature: \$r{$<$}0.028\$ and \$-1.37 {$<$} n\_t {$<$} 0.42\$ at 95\% confidence level. Furthermore, our examination of the common signal detected by the NANOGrav Collaboration further confirms that a simple power-law cannot reconcile the constraints from different datasets if the NANOGrav detection is due to a primordial inflationary gravitational wave background, as previously shown in the literature.},

  abstract = {We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and \$\textbackslash alpha\$-attractors, including the recently developed \$\textbackslash alpha\$-attractor models with \$SL(2,\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\})\$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters \$A\_\{s\}\$, \$n\_\{s\}\$ and \$r\$.},
