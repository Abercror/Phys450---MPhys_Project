    Despite the successes of the Big Bang Theory, there are problems that occur when examining the very earliest moments of the universe. The Inflationary Paradigm is a potential answer to these problems; however, there are a plethora of different models that explain this in their own way. As of now, no model has been proven, with the most successful ones being Starobinsky Inflation and $\alpha$-attractor models. These models are those that best align with the Planck 2018 \cite{Collaboration2020} observational bounds of the spectral index and tensor ratio, though there is potential for observations to disprove the Inflationary Paradigm completely. Alternative ideas to explain the problems of the Big Bang Theory include String Gas Cosmology and the Ekpyrotic scenario, though these ideas have their own limitations and flaws. This review will explore Cosmic Inflation and specifically slow-roll inflation, the type of inflation that the most successful models belong to, before briefly examining the aforementioned inflationary models.

\section{Prologue}\label{section: Prologue}

On large scales, the universe follows the Cosmological Principle, which states that the universe is both homogenous and isotropic in every direction \cite{dimopoulosIntroductionCosmicInflation2020}. This is a rather simple idea, equating to the universe appearing to be the same everywhere on large scales; however, the reason why the universe exists in this manner is not so simple. 

% In the years following Einstein's publication of `The Foundations of the General Theory of Relativity' \cite{Einstein1916foundationgeneraltheoryrelativity}, 2 of the simplest cosmological models were the Einstein universe and the de Sitter universe. Both were static models, though they differed in their composition, with the Einstein model containing a non-zero density for matter, for which he was required to include a cosmological constant, $\Lambda,$ to prevent the universe from collapsing in on itself, while the de Sitter model neglects ordinary matter and is dominated by this cosmological constant. The model that Einstein described is static due to his inclusion of the cosmological constant, and the de Sitter model is one that undergoes rapid expansion, and unlike the Einstein model, it satisfies the Cosmological Principle.

Following Einstein's publication of `The Foundations of the General Theory of Relativity' \cite{Einstein1916foundationgeneraltheoryrelativity}, in 1932, Willem de Sitter and Einstein proposed a model containing only dark energy \cite{Einstein1932}, parametrised as the cosmological constant included in the Einstein equations. This universe would undergo rapid accelerated expansion due to its domination by dark energy \cref{eq: scale factor relations}. This would later come to be known as the de Sitter model and is used to describe the expansion of Cosmic Inflation. 


The universe was first discovered to be expanding by Edwin Hubble \cite{Hubble1929relationdistanceradialvelocityextragalacticnebulae} in 1929, though this was a known prediction derived from General Relativity \cite{Sauer2005AlbertEinsteins1916ReviewArticleGeneralRelativity}. It was first done so by Alexander Friedmann in his 1922 paper `On the Curvature of Spacetime' \cite{AlexanderFriedmannCurvatureSpace}, in which he derived what would come to be known as the Friedmann-Lema\^itre equations \cite{RomeuDerivationFriedmanequations}. The discovery that the universe was not static and was expanding led to research into the origins of the universe. A prominent theory was put forward by Stephen Hawking \cite{Hawking1966}, proposing that a space-time singularity of infinite density was a natural consequence of the Big Bang Theory.


% , as in 1927 Georges Lema\^itre independently derived them \cite{1927ASSB4749LPage49}. Friedmann demonstrated that the energy density of matter, $\rho(t)$, and the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, were linked with the time evolution of the universe.

However, despite the success of models such as these, they did not solve all the problems regarding the origin of the universe, notably the Horizon Problem, \cref{subsection: The Horizon Problem}, and the Flatness Problem, \cref{subsection: The Flatness Problem}, are not solved. 

The idea of cosmic inflation was proposed by Alan Guth in 1981 \cite{Guth1981}, outlining inflation as a potential solution to both the Horizon Problem and the Flatness Problem. This was then built upon, notably by Alexander Starobinsky, who independently proposed one of the most successful inflation models. Many different models have been proposed, including trying to embed inflationary models into theoretical frameworks such as string theory and supergravity, but no model has been successfully proven. 



%% Inflation crash course
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{A brief crash course}\label{subsubsection: A brief crash course}

The Hubble Parameter, $H$, is defined as the expansion rate of the universe and is given by the formula 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Hubble Parameter}
    H = \frac{\dot{a}}{a},
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the scale factor of the universe and the overdots, $\dot{x}$, represent derivatives with respect to time. 
This is a key part of the 2 non-linear ordinary differential equations derived by Friedmann, with the first being 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Friedmann Equation}
    H^2 \equiv \left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3 m_p^2}\rho - \frac{k}{a^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \rho = 3 m_p^2 H^2,
\end{equation}
known as the Friedmann equation where $\rho$ is the energy density, $m_p$ is the reduced Plank Mass and $k$ is the curvature, which for a flat universe $k = 0$, and is used to derive
\begin{equation}\label{eq: acceleration equation}
    \dot{H} + H^2 = \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = - \frac{1}{6 m_p^2}\left( \rho + 3p \right),
\end{equation}
known as the acceleration equation, where $p$ is the pressure exerted by the contents of the universe. 

In an expanding universe, ($\dot{a} > 0$), filled with matter that satisfies $\rho + 3p \ge 0$, means \cref{eq: acceleration equation} implies $\ddot{a} <0$. The indication of this condition is that there was a singularity in the finite past, $a(t\equiv0) = 0$, known as the Big Bang singularity. Combining \cref{eq: Friedmann Equation,eq: acceleration equation}, results in the continuity equation 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Continuity equation}
    \dot{\rho} + 3H(\rho + p) = 0.
\end{equation}
Defining 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Barotropic parameter}
    w = \frac{\rho}{p},
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the barotropic parameter for the universe, means that the continuity equation, \cref{eq: Continuity equation} may be integrated to find the relation of the energy density to the scale factor, taking the form 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: rho to a}
    \rho \propto a^{-3(1 + w)}.
\end{equation}
$\rho$ is the total energy density of the universe, though it can be used for the individual constituent of the universe, denoted by $\rho_i$, where the energy density of each constituent is determined by its barotropic parameter. The properties of each constituent and its effect on the parameters of the universe, the relations vary as shown in \cref{table: Composition relations}, where matter includes baryonic and dark matter.
\begin{wraptable}{l}{7cm}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm}||p{0.6cm}|p{0.6cm}|p{0.6cm}}

          $i$  & $w$ & $\rho(a)$ & $a(t)$ \\
        \hline
        \text{matter, $m$} & $0$ & $a^{-3}$ & $t^{\frac{2}{3}}$ \\

        \text{radiation, $\gamma$} & $\frac{1}{3}$ & $a^{-4}$ & $t^{\frac{1}{2}}$ \\

        \text{dark energy, $\Lambda$} & $-1$ & $a^0$ & $e^{Ht}$ \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The relation between each of the constituents of the universe and their relations to the universal parameters.}
    \label{table: Composition relations}
\end{wraptable}


If multiple constituents are contributing, then the energy density is the sum of each constituent's contribution. Combining this with the Friedmann equation, \cref{eq: Friedmann Equation}, demonstrates the relation between the scale factor and time, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: scale factor relations}
  a(t)\propto
  \begin{cases}
    t^{\frac{2}{3(1+w)}}, & \text{for } w \ne -1,\\[4pt]
    e^{Ht},               & \text{for } w = -1, 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where the scale factor relation for $w = -1$ is the relation present in the de Sitter universe model, as it is composed of only dark energy. 

For an accelerated rate of expansion (i.e. $\ddot{a} > 0$),$w < -\frac{1}{3}$ is required, and from \cref{table: Composition relations} it can be inferred that the dominant constituent must be dark energy. Dark energy is a substance with the interesting property of exerting a negative pressure and is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. It is modelled as a fluid; however, it expands the universe by expanding the space between non-gravitationally bound objects. It is denoted by $\Lambda$ and in the currently accepted universe model, the $\Lambda$CDM model, it is dominant, causing the accelerated expansion observed. The observed composition ratio of the universe at present from Planck \cite{Collaboration2020} is that matter and dark energy account for approximately $31\%$ and $69\%$ of the energy density, respectively, using Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO $68\%$ limits.


%% Problems with the Hot Big Bang
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Problems with the Hot Big Bang}\label{subsection: section: Problems with the Hot Big Bang}
The Big Bang refers to the initial explosion that started the universe and is not to be confused with the Hot Big Bang, which instead refers to the thermal history of the universe that began after the Big Bang. It describes the history of the universe, initially dominated by radiation and then by matter, but it does not include dark energy domination that occurred in very early and late times \cite{dimopoulosIntroductionCosmicInflation2020}. 

Both the density of matter and radiation are inversely proportional to time, $\rho_m \propto a^{-3}, \; \rho_{\gamma} \propto a^{-4}$, meaning that the total density at the start of the universe would be very large. With all the energy and matter in a very reduced space, the temperature was incredibly high; however, as that space begins to increase, the average energy across would reduce, meaning that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Temperature Relation to scale factor} 
    T \propto \frac{1}{a},
\end{equation} meaning that the universe cools down as it expands. 

The Cosmic Microwave Background was formed during a period called decoupling, which occurred approximately 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang. Decoupling is the period where radiation became decoupled from matter and was able to escape. Before this, radiation was trapped, continuously interacting with matter, and this first release of radiation became the CMB. 

The Hot Big Bang is supported by different forms of observational evidence, not limited to the universe expansion, the age of the universe and the CMB radiation. However, there are many problems it does not answer, such as the nature of dark energy and dark matter, as well as the origin of the structure that is seen throughout the universe. Other notable problems are the Horizon and the Flatness problem, which have to do with the universe being too uniform and are the main topic of this section.


%% The Horizon Problem
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The Horizon Problem}\label{subsection: The Horizon Problem}

\begin{figure}[H]\label{fig: The Horizon Problem}
    \begin{center}
        \includesvg[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/FRWHorizon}
        \caption{This demonstrates the Horizon Problem in conformal time \cite{baumannTASILecturesInflation2012} as the areas are not in causal contact and therefore should not feature the same characteristics.}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
Within cosmology, a horizon refers to a boundary of causal contact that separates the observer from anything beyond it. 
The Hubble Horizon is the limit of causal connection, meaning that if an object is beyond this point, then nothing may communicate with it again as it is receding faster than the speed of light, $c$ \cite{dimopoulosIntroductionCosmicInflation2020}. The Particle Horizon is the maximum distance light could have travelled since decoupling, as it takes into account the expansion of space 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Hubble Horizon and Particle Horizon}
    x_H(t) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{c dt'}{a(t')}, \quad  D_H(t) = a(t)x_H(t),
\end{equation}
where $x_H(t)$ is the Hubble Horizon and $D_H(t)$ is the Particle Horizon. 
% The Event Horizon corresponds to the maximum possible extent of causal relations where the upper limit is $\infty$, though depending on the universe model is limited to
% \begin{equation}\label{eq: Event Horizon}
%     D_H(t) = a(t)x_H(t) = a(t) \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{c dt'}{a(t')}.
% \end{equation}

The Horizon Problem \cite{zotero-item-168} is the problem of the homogeneity that is observed in the CMB, over distances that are not causally connected as they appear to be in thermal equilibrium. The temperature seen when observing the CMB in one direction is in equilibrium with the observations taken in the opposite direction, even though it would take light at least 14 billion years to send light to each other. 

The regions were not within causal contact during the period of decoupling \cref{fig: The Horizon Problem}, meaning that interactions couldn't take place between them. This means that it is highly unlikely they would appear homogeneous. The analytical description of the Horizon Problem is as follows \cite{dimopoulosIntroductionCosmicInflation2020},
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Horizon Problem}
    \frac{D_{H}(t_0)}{D_H(t)} = \frac{D_H(t_0) a(t)}{D_H(t) a(t_0)} \approx \frac{H(t) a(t)}{H(t_0) a(t_0)} = \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{\dot{a}(t_0)},
\end{equation}
where subscript $,_0$ refers to present time and $\dot{a} = aH$ \cref{eq: Hubble Parameter}. What this shows is that as $t \rightarrow 0$, the universe becomes increasingly causally disconnected, which raises the question of how the CMB is homogenous at distances beyond the Hubble Horizon \cref{eq: Hubble Horizon and Particle Horizon}. 




%% The Flatness Problem
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The Flatness Problem}\label{subsection: The Flatness Problem}

The Flatness Problem is one of the topology of the universe, as the universe appears to be spatially flat despite a flat universe being unstable, meaning the initial conditions require extreme fine-tuning \cite{Lake2005}. Spacetime is dynamic and is warped by mass as stated by General Relativity \cite{Einstein1916foundationgeneraltheoryrelativity}, and so with all the mass that is present within the universe, why is it approximately a flat Euclidean plane?

Recall the Friedmann equation, \cref{eq: Friedmann Equation}, and the energy density ratio, $\Omega = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_c}$, where $\rho_c$ is the critical density. The Friedmann equation can be rewritten in the form 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Curvature Friedmann equation}
    \Omega(a) - 1 = \frac{k}{(aH)^2} \quad \text{where} \quad \Omega(a) \equiv \frac{\rho(a)}{\rho_{c}(a)}, \quad \rho_{c}(a) \equiv 3H(a)^2,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega(a)$ is defined to be time-dependent \cite{baumannTASILecturesInflation2012}.

Using the equation above \cite{dimopoulosIntroductionCosmicInflation2020},
\begin{equation}\label{eq: The Flatness Problem relation}
    \frac{|\Omega(t_0) -1 |}{|\Omega(t) -1|} = \left( \frac{a(t) H(t)}{a(t_0)H(t_0)} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{\dot{a}(t_0)} \right)^2,
\end{equation}
and that $\dot{a}(t)$ is a decreasing function then $|\Omega(t_0) -1 | > |\Omega -1|$ for all $t > t_0$, showing that the deviation from flatness grows with time \cref{fig: The Flatness Problem}. 
This begs the question, why $\Omega(a_0)$ not either much greater or smaller than 1, as observations suggest?

\begin{figure}[H]\label{fig: The Flatness Problem}
    \begin{center}
        \includesvg[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/TheFlatnessProblem}
        \caption{This graph demonstrates the curvature against time for the universe, and shows that deviation from flatness is an exponential deviation, highlighting the fine-tuning required for the $\Omega = 1$, as observations suggest \cite{dimopoulosIntroductionCosmicInflation2020}.}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Density Perturbations}\label{subsection: Density Perturbations}

As previously stated, the cosmological principle is not exact, as demonstrated by the existence of any structure within the universe, and this cannot be explained by the Hot Big Bang. There exist density perturbations that give the CMB its characteristic look as photons become redshifted. The photons lose energy trying to overcome the gravitational potential exerted on them by the overdensity, resulting in variations in the temperature of the CMB. The differences in the temperature correlate with the density perturbations 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Temperature to density perturbations}
    \left. \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right|_{CMB}  \simeq \left. \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right|_{CMB} \simeq 10^{-5},
\end{equation}
giving a very tiny deviation, but allows for the formation of the structure observed today. 



%% Cosmic Inflation
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Cosmic Inflation}\label{section: Cosmic Inflation}
Cosmic Inflation is defined as a period of superluminal expansion that occurred before the Hot Big Bang, meaning that this period of expansion in the early universe exceeded the speed of light. At this time, baryon genesis, the formation of baryons, has not yet occurred, so the universe is entirely dominated by dark energy, meaning inflation is a de Sitter universe, $w = -1$. 

Initially, this idea seems to be impossible as it would break the laws of General Relativity, limiting anything with mass from moving faster than the speed of light. This does not apply to inflation, however, because it is not matter or energy that is being displaced with a velocity greater than light speed, but spacetime itself that is expanding. An analogy to this is if spacetime is considered to be the surface of a balloon, the balloon expands with a certain velocity, and the space on its surface grows. Considering an infinitesimal point on the surface, it has no velocity as it is not moving across the surface of the balloon, and yet it is changed from its initial absolute position, as the nature of space itself has changed.

% \footnote{Spacetime: the 4-dimensional fabric described by General Relativity, composed of the 3-spatial dimensions and time}

As previously stated, \cref{eq: Temperature Relation to scale factor}, the temperature of the universe is inversely proportional to the scale factor, so as the universe expands, the temperature decreases, as the density of matter and energy decreases. Due to the speed of inflation, the temperature of the thermal bath would be drastically depleted, but at the end of inflation, the Hot Big Bang occurs, which requires a significant thermal bath. Before explaining the mechanism of how this thermal bath is recovered, it is important to explain primordial density perturbations. 

While the Cosmological Principle states that on large scales the universe is isotropic, due to the nature of quantum mechanics, small perturbations occur, so on the small scale it is not isotropic. These very early perturbations can be seen today as they have been cast into the CMB, showing the inhomogeneities in the early universe. These density perturbations were the initial perturbations that occurred before any gravitational growth, and have 3 key properties: they are adiabatic, nearly scale-invariant, and follow a Gaussian distribution. 

% An adiabatic perturbation is a type of perturbation where the fractional perturbation of the number density of each conserved matter type is equal to the fractional perturbation in the number density of photons. The reason that this is adiabatic is that the very early universe acted as a thermally isolated volume, and so the perturbations themselves also looked like a thermally isolated volume. This, combined with the maintenance of thermal equilibrium, means that no heat is transferred out of the system and is therefore adiabatic.  

An adiabatic perturbation is a type of perturbation where the fractional perturbation of the number density of each conserved matter type is equal to the fractional perturbation in the number density of photons. The very early universe acted as a thermally isolated system, meaning that despite the entropy remaining constant throughout, it allowed for the perturbations to be adiabatic.

The perturbations are nearly scale-invariant, meaning their size is not dependent on a specific scale. However, during quasi-de Sitter inflation, the Hubble parameter is not exactly constant, meaning the amplitudes of the perturbations vary slightly depending on the scale that exits the horizon at that time. This dependence is parametrised as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Curvature Parameter}
    \mathcal{P}_{\zeta} \propto k^{n_s - 1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_s - 1 =  \dv{\ln \mathcal{P}_{\zeta}}{\ln k},
\end{equation}
where $k$ is a constant and $n_s$ is the spectral index of the curvature perturbation spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}$, with the most recent Planck satellite observations $n_s = 0.9649 \pm 0.0042$ \cite{Collaboration2020}. 
These perturbations have been observed to follow a Gaussian distribution to a high level of accuracy, with the search for non-Gaussianity being an active research area. 
% \begin{equation}\label{eq: Gaussian Distribution}
%     P\left(\delta_{rho}, \Delta \delta_{\rho} \right) = N \exp\left(  - \frac{\delta^2_{\rho}}{2 {< \delta^2_{\rho} >}_{\rho}}  \right)  \Delta \delta_{\rho},  \quad N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi {< \delta^2_{\rho} >}_{\rho}}}
% \end{equation}

Another by-product of inflation is the generation of gravitational waves (gravitons), and the graviton spectrum is also approximately nearly scale-invariant, with an amplitude parametrised as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Graviton Spectrum}
    \sqrt{\mathcal{P}_{h}} = 2 \sqrt{16 \pi G} \left(\frac{H}{2 \pi}\right).
\end{equation}

These gravitational waves distort the CMB similarly to the adiabatic density perturbations, such that they can provide a consistent relation for single-field inflation. The ratio of the amplitude of the CMB temperature perturbations is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Tensor ratio}
    r \equiv \frac{\mathcal{P}_{h}}{\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}} = \left( \frac{\left(\Delta T/T \right)_{grav}}{\left( \Delta T / T \right)_{\delta \rho/\rho}} \right)^2.
\end{equation}


One way to combine this is through the Inflationary Paradigm, where inflation is modelled using a scalar field. The decay of this scalar field at the end of inflation recovers the thermal bath, allowing the Hot Big Bang to occur. 


%% Mathematics of the Inflationary Paradigm
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The Mathematical Description of the Inflationary Paradigm}\label{subsection: Mathematical description of Inflation}

Inflation in its simplest form is modelled by a single scalar field, $\phi$, called the inflaton. This field is minimally coupled to gravity and is parametrised in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert action 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Einstein-Hilbert Action}
    S = \int d^4 x\, \sqrt{-g} \left( \frac{1}{2} m_p^2 R + \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi - V(\phi)  \right) = S_{EH} + S_{\phi},
\end{equation}
where $V(\phi)$ is the inflaton potential. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over all space-time dimensions, $\dd[4]{x}$. The inflaton action, $S_{\phi}$, is simply an addition to the Einstein-Hilbert action, and it describes the self-interactions within the scalar field.

A scalar field is defined as a spin-zero field, assuming a unique value at each infinitesimal point in space, $\phi \left( \boldsymbol{x},t \right)$. The inflaton field is a homogenous scalar field, $\phi = \phi(t)$, and an energy density and pressure defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Density and Pressure of Homogeneous scalar field}
    \rho_{\phi} = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi) \quad \text{and} \quad p_{\phi} = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 - V(\phi).  
\end{equation}

For quasi-de Sitter inflation, $w_{\phi} \approx -1$, the inflaton field must obey the condition $\dot{\phi}^2 \ll V$, meaning that $\phi$ varies very slowly with time.

Analogous to Newton's equations of motion for a particle, the Klein-Gordon equation describes the motion of a homogeneous scalar field as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Klein-Gordon Equation}
    \ddot{\phi} + 3H\dot{\phi} + V' = 0, \quad \text{where} \quad V' = \derivative{V(\phi)}{\phi},
\end{equation}
where $3H$ and $V'$ correspond to the frictional and potential terms, respectively. In the case of quasi-de Sitter inflation, $\ddot{\phi}$ is negligible, resulting in 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Slow Roll Approximation}
    3H \dot{\phi} \approx -V',    
\end{equation}
known as the slow-roll approximation. 


%% Slow Roll Inflation
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Slow-Roll Inflation}\label{subsection: Slow-Roll Inflation}
Slow-roll inflation refers to the motion of the inflaton, $\phi$, in the potential, $V(\phi)$, slowed by the high friction term, $3H$.

%%Insert Figure showing slow-roll inflation

Inflation is measured in e-foldings, where each e-folding refers to the amount of time for the scale factor, $a(t)$, to increase by a factor of $e$. The total number of e-foldings is given in the 2 forms 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: No. e-foldings scale factor}
    N = \ln{\left(\frac{a_{end}}{a(t)}\right)} \quad \text{and} \quad \dd{N} = -H\dd{t}
\end{equation}
where $a_{end}$ refers to the end of inflation and $H \approx const$. The second expression can be recast into the form 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: No. e-foldings integral}
    N(\phi) \approx \frac{1}{m_p^2} \int_{\phi_{end}}^{\phi} \frac{V}{V'} d \phi', 
\end{equation}
using the slow-roll approximation \cref{eq: Slow Roll Approximation} and the Friedmann equation \cref{eq: Friedmann Equation} where $V \approx \rho$.

The slow-roll parameter, $\epsilon$, is the parameterisation change in the universe's expansion rate, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Epsilon paramter H}
    \epsilon \equiv - \frac{\dot{H}}{H^2}, \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\dd{H}}{H} = \epsilon \dv{N}
\end{equation}
and for numerous e-foldings to occur, $\epsilon \ll 1$.

Recalling that for quasi-de Sitter inflation to occur $\dot{\phi} \ll V(\phi)$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Epsilon parameter slow roll}
    \epsilon \approx \frac{1}{2} m_p^2 \left( \frac{V'}{V} \right) = \frac{3}{2}(1+w),
\end{equation}
and as $w \approx -1$, slow-roll inflation is possible only if $\epsilon \ll 1$ \cite{Liddle1994}.

However, the requirement for the continuation of inflation is $| \ddot{\phi} | \ll |3H \dot{\phi}|$ corresponding to the acceleration of the inflation being dominated by the frictional component of the field, as this allows for the continuation of the inflationary period. It is parametrised by the second slow-roll parameter, $\eta$, which is defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Eta slow-roll parameter}
    \eta = m_p^2 \frac{V''}{V},
\end{equation}
which fulfils the condition, if $\eta \ll 1$.

$\epsilon$ and $\eta$ are the 2 parametrised conditions required of the slow-roll inflation conditions 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Slow-roll conditions}
    \dot{\phi} \ll V(\phi) \quad \text{and} \quad |\ddot{\phi}| \ll |3H\dot{\phi}|, 
\end{equation}
which correspond to
\begin{equation}\label{eq: slow-roll parameters condition}
    \epsilon, |\eta | < 1.
\end{equation}
However, as $\phi$ is time-dependent and its magnitude decreases with time, the conditions for inflation \cref{eq: Slow-roll conditions} are eventually violated, bringing inflation to an end. This occurs at either
\begin{equation}\label{eq: End of inflation condition}
    \epsilon\left(\phi_{end}\right) = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad |\eta(\phi_{end})| = 1,
\end{equation}
so depending on the inflaton potential, either $\epsilon$ or $\eta$ will reach 1 first, ending the inflationary period, $\phi_{end}$. 

The spectral index and the tensor ratio of the density perturbations may be recast using the slow-roll parameters, which give the relations
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Spectral index using slow-roll parameters}
    n_s - 1 = \dv{\ln \mathcal{P}_{\zeta}}{\ln k} = 2 \eta - 6 \epsilon \quad \text{and} \quad
    r \equiv \frac{\mathcal{P}_{h}}{\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}} = 16 \epsilon.
\end{equation}


%% How Inflation solves the Horizon and Flatness Problem
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{How Inflation solves the Horizon and Flatness Problems}\label{subsection: How Inflation solves the Horizon and Flatness Problems}

Both the Horizon and Flatness problems are solved by inflation, as this period of superluminal expansion allows for the initial conditions of the universe to be isotropic before the Hot Big Bang. This expansion creates the homogeneity in areas that are not in causal contact at the end of inflation, and so after the Hot Big Bang, they retain this homogeneity. The decay of the inflaton field at the end of inflation reforms the thermal bath that was lost due to the rapid expansion, which is possible due to the adiabatic nature of the perturbations, and so the entropy decays into energy. 

\subsubsection*{Condition to solve the Horizon Problem}\label{subsubsection: Conditions to solve the Horizon Problem}

Recalling from section \cref{subsection: The Horizon Problem}, the mathematical description of the Horizon problem is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Horizon Problem Short}
    \frac{R_{obs}(t)}{D_H(t)} = \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{\dot{a}(t_0)},
\end{equation}
which shows that in order to solve the Horizon Problem, $R_{obs} (t_i)\leq D_H(t_0)$ to allow for the regions to be causally correlated. From this, it is true that
\begin{equation}\label{eq: solving Horizon problem scale factor}
    \dot{a}(t_i) \leq \dot{a}(t_0) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\dot{a}_i}{\dot{a}_{end}} \leq \frac{\dot{a}_0}{\dot{a}_{end}},
\end{equation}
where $i$ and $end$ denote the start and end of inflation. 

After the end of inflation $\ddot{a} < 0$, so $\frac{\dot{a}_0}{\dot{a}_{end}} < 1$, therefore $\frac{\dot{a}_i}{\dot{a}_{end}}$ needs to be even smaller. As previously mentioned, inflation undergoes accelerated expansion, $\ddot{a} > 0$, which means that inflation solves the Horizon Problem under the condition that it lasts long enough. 

\subsubsection*{Condition to solve the Flatness Problem}\label{subsubsection: Condition to solve the Flatness Problem}

In \cref{eq: The Flatness Problem relation} it is shown that $| \Omega(t) - 1| \propto \dot{a}^{-2}$, however, during inflation $\ddot{a} > 0$ meaning $\dot{a}$ is growing, so the deviation from flatness diminishes. This means that the criteria for inflation to solve the Flatness Problem can be written as 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\dot{a}_i}{\dot{a}_0} = \sqrt{\frac{|\Omega_0 - 1|}{|\Omega_i - 1 |}}.
\end{equation}

From this, it can be seen that the longer inflation lasts, the smaller the deviation from flatness becomes, and so inflation solves the Flatness Problems assuming it lasts long enough. 


Both the Horizon and Flatness Problems are solved by inflation, provided that inflation lasts long enough. This time period for inflation to solve them is about 60 e-foldings. This sets a minimum time that inflation has to last, and this can be accomplished by all inflation models. However, in order for inflation to create the primordial density perturbations that allow for the structure formation in the universe, only specific inflation models can cause that. The Inflationary Paradigm, where dark energy is modelled as a scalar field, allows for slow-roll inflation to occur, and it is slow-roll inflation that allows for the deviation of the spectral index to align with the observations that are seen today.

\section{Models of Inflation}\label{section: Notable Models of Inflation}

    \label{fig: Inflationary Model Comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Starobinsky Inflation}\label{subsection: Starobinsky Inflation}
Starobinsky or $R^2$ inflation was originally proposed in 1980 by Alexander Starobinsky \cite{Starobinsky1980a} and, in doing so, coined the name cosmic inflation. It gets the name $R^2$ inflation from the fact that it is derived from a modification to the Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity, \cref{eq: Einstein-Hilbert Action}, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar. The Lagrangian density for gravity is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian}
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} m_p^2 R,
\end{equation}
and Starobinsky Inflation modifies it with the addition of another $R^2$ term. It then takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Starobinsky Lagrangian}
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} m_p^2 R + \frac{1}{2} \alpha R^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \alpha \equiv \frac{m_p^4}{16 V_0},
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ is the initial value for the inflaton potential. This Lagrangian density results in the following potential for the inflaton 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Starobinsky Potential}
    V(\phi) = V_0 \left( 1 - e^{\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \frac{\phi}{m_p}}  \right)^2.
\end{equation}

Starobinsky inflation has been one of the most successful inflation models, and its predictions lie within the observational bounds from the Planck surveys \cite{Collaboration2020} for $N = 60$. There is currently a tension with the Starobinsky model due to the recent observations from the Atacama telescope, though these were the first publications of results and so may change in the future. 

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\alpha$}{alpha}-attractors}\label{subsection: alpha-attractors}

%     \end{center}
% \end{figure}

$\alpha$-attractors are an example of a modern inflationary model which also aligns with the observational bounds. The two main models for $\alpha$-attractors are the T-model and the E-model \cite{kalloshPresentStatusInflationary2025} which take the form:
\begin{equation}
    \text{T-model:} \quad V(\varphi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \varphi^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad V(\phi) = 3\alpha m^2m_p^2 \tanh[2](\frac{1}{\sqrt{6 \alpha}} \frac{\phi}{m_p^2})\label{eq: T-model} \quad \text{and}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{E-model:} \quad V(\varphi) = \frac{\frac{1}{2} m^2 \varphi^2}{\left( 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{6 \alpha}} \frac{\varphi}{m_p}  \right)^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad V(\phi) = \frac{3}{4} \alpha m^2 m_p^2 \left( 1 - e^{- \sqrt{\frac{2}{3 \alpha}} \frac{\phi}{m_p}}  \right)^2 \label{eq: E-model},
\end{equation}
with the E-model being a form of the Starobinsky potential when $V_0 = 3\alpha m^2 m_p^2$ and $\alpha = 1$.
The origin of these models lies in supergravity \cite{Kallosh2015} and are dependent on the dimensionless parameter $\alpha$. \cref{fig: Inflationary Model Comparison} shows the bounds of both models as they have the same tensor ratio to spectral index. It demonstrates a range of $\alpha$ values, though typically in supergravity the typical values are $3 \alpha = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7$ \cite{Kallosh2019}. 

The models are derived using the Lagrangian kinetic term for the non-canonical scalar field, $\varphi$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: Lagrangian kinetic term}
    \mathcal{L}_{kin} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \partial \varphi ^2}{\left( 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{6 \alpha}} \left( \frac{\varphi}{m_p} \right)^2 \right)^2},
\end{equation}
with poles at $\varphi = \pm \sqrt{6 \alpha} m_p$.  Using a canonical normalisation, $V(\varphi)$ is transformed to $V(\phi)$ giving rise to the potentials above, \cref{eq: T-model,eq: E-model}. This stretches the poles to infinity, and so this flattening of the potential allows for a plateau in the potential to give the required behaviour to the inflaton.




%% Problems with Inflation
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Problems with Inflation}\label{section: Problems with Inflation}

One of the major problems with cosmic inflation is that there is a very large amount of flexibility in the predictions of individual inflationary models. This brings into question whether the Inflationary Paradigm itself is falsifiable, and specifically the Paradigm, not individual models, as they are clearly falsifiable. The doubt regards the entire scenario as a whole and whether there are alternative explanations for the creation of density perturbations and solutions to the Horizon and Flatness Problems. 

In parallel to the CMB, there potentially could exist a thermal background of relic gravitons, resulting from the decoupling of primordial gravitons around Planck time. The discovery of the CGB \cite{Vagnozzi2022}, Cosmic Graviton Background, would rule out the Inflationary Paradigm as inflationary models would wash this out, meaning that it would be undetectable. However, some of the alternatives to inflation allow for a CGB to remain detectable, and so the validity of inflation is dependent on the CGB being detectable. 


%% Alternatives to Inflation
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Alternatives to Inflation}\label{section: Alternatives to Inflation}

There exist alternative propositions that attempt to solve the Horizon and Flatness Problems and to create the density perturbations observed. The main ones discussed here are String Gas Cosmology, Variable Speed of Light and the Ekpyrotic scenario, though others exist, such as the Matter Bounce hypothesis.  

\subsubsection*{String Gas Cosmology}\label{subsubsection: String Gas Cosmology}

% String Gas Cosmology, SGC, uses degrees of freedom and symmetries present in string theory, and is based on the coupling of the background space-time geometry to a gas of closed string matter \cite{Brandenberger2008}. String Theory naturally includes the graviton \cite{Scherk1974}, hence allowing for the potential emergence of the CGB, and like in string theory, SGC compacts all spatial dimensions and assumes that they are toroidal with a radius for the torus being $R$. 

% Strings have 3 types of modes that they may exist in: momentum modes representing the energy of the strings, oscillatory modes which represent the fluctuations and the winding modes which refer to the number of times the string is wrapped around the torus. The number of the oscillatory states increases exponentially with an increase in energy; however there is a limiting temperature for a string gas to be in thermal equilibrium, and so the temperature remains constant if the volume changes adiabatically within the Hagedorn regime. 

% One of the major problems of string gas cosmology is that stabilising all the string moduli, as the size and shape of the extra dimensions must also be stabilised. SGC was originally developed using tools from a specific type of string theory, heterotic string theory, and while it does not require heterotic strings they are most commonly used, and they support the T-duality symmetry, which is a symmetry through the compactification of the radius $R \rightarrow 1/R$, which transforms one string theory to another meaning that they are dualities of each other under this symmetry \cite{Brandenberger2011}. 


String Gas Cosmology, SGC, is based on the coupling of the spacetime geometry to a gas of string matter \cite{Brandenberger2008}, as an alternative explanation to inflation. As String Theory naturally includes the graviton \cite{Scherk1974}, it would be able to produce the CGB if detected. An infinite temperature is prevented in this model, which causes the universe to undergo a slow contraction phase during which the universe becomes homogenous, solving the Horizon Problem. The Flatness Problem is solved as the internal dynamics of strings and branes drive the universe towards being flat. 

The problem with this proposition is that it is based entirely on speculative physics, String Theory, and it produces relics such as gravitinos and magnetic monopoles \cite{Battefeld2009}. This is a major problem as it requires another phase of inflation to address these problems and to dilute them to align with observations. 

\subsubsection*{Variable Speed of Light}\label{subsubsection: Variable speed of light}

Variable Speed of Light cosmology proposes that during the early universe, the speed of light was faster than today \cite{Moffat2002}. This proposition solves the Horizon Problem as a higher speed of light means that the Hubble Horizon, or boundary of causal contact, was larger, and so the homogenous regions observed were in causal contact before the Hot Big Bang. This proposition also explains the Flatness Problem by asserting that the higher speed of light stretches the universe, and then the speed of light drastically decreases, flattening the curvature to what is observed. Primordial density perturbations are also permitted to exist within this model \cite{Moffat2016}, while being nearly scale-invariant to align with the spectral index observed. 

While this proposition solves both the Horizon and Flatness Problems while allowing for the creation of primordial density perturbations, the physics of this reduction is unclear \cite{Albrecht1999}. Some models propose $c(t)$, \cite{Barrow1999}, where it is modelled as a continuous function inversely proportional to the scale factor. However, this would require continual changes in $c$ which have not been observed. 


\subsubsection*{Ekpyrotic Scenario}\label{subsubsection: Ekpyrotic Scenario}

The Ekpyrotic model was originally introduced in an attempt to explain what occurred before the Big Bang. It was derived from String Theory, explaining the Big Bang as 2 linked branes \cite{Langlois2002}, making contact and the resulting movement apart being the expansion of the universe. It has been incorporated into cyclical cosmological models \cite{Lehners2008}, where the collapsing of the universe results in a new one. 

This model assumes that the universe originated as an empty BPS \cite{Kan2024} state that lasted an exponentially long time before the Hot Big Bang \cite{Khoury2001}. This assumption is what explains the Flatness Problem by just assuming flatness. The Horizon Problem is solved as the colliding branes create global conditions for the universe. 

Problems with this model are that it is based on speculative physics and originally offered no reason for the attraction between the branes. Another problem is that the solution to the Horizon and Flatness Problems is setting the initial conditions such that they do not exist. However, consequently, this doesn't explain the fine-tuning problem and instead makes it more prominent.   

% \subsubsection*{Matter Bounce}\label{subsubsection: Matter Bounce}

% Matter bounce is another alternative to the Inflationary Paradigm that obtains the scale-invariant density perturbations, which exit the Hubble radius in a contracting matter-dominated phase that occurs before the Big Bang. After the contracting phase, a bounce follows, and then the standard phases of Big Bang cosmology occur. This approach solves the Horizon and the Flatness Problems similarly to the Inflationary Paradigm, but it also avoids reaching a singularity at the time of the Big Bang \cite{Li2017}. 

% The typical way this idea is constructed is through the existence of a new scalar field, and so with a canonical Lagrangian, oscillations from the scalar field can drive the contracting phase when the ratio of the pressure to the energy density averages 0. With an increasing energy scale of the universe, extra terms appear in the Lagrangian that drive a nonsingular bounce. 

% This alternative to the Inflationary Paradigm also has its problems with one of the big ones being the creation of ghosts that occurfromm the creation of the different matter fields \cite{Brandenberger2011}. The phantom behaviour of these fields is not problematic so long as the energy density remains smaller than that corresponding to the phantom field mass scale. Under these conditions it may be considered to be a low-energy effective field theory, however, a scenario involving this is unstable with the presence of radiation which was every present in the very early universe. 

% Matter Bounce is another alternative that involves a contracting phase followed by a bounce, during which standard Big Bang cosmology occurs. This model solves the Horizon and Flatness Problems as the contracting phase allows for the distant regions to come into causal contact as well as driving spatial flatness. The proposed mechanism behind this is that scalar fields oscillate and drive the contracting phase of the universe, and depending on the energy scale more than one bounce may occur \cite{Li2017}.

% The problem with this model is the creation of ghosts due to the new scalar fields \cite{Brandenberger2011}, and the phantom behaviour of these fields is problematic except in a low-energy range. This is incompatible with the amount of radiation that would be present in the very early universe meaning that this model and so this model is not very successful.

\section{Conclusion}\label{section: Conclusion}

Cosmic Inflation is a scenario constructed to solve the problems of the Hot Big Bang, specifically the Horizon Problem, the Flatness Problem and allows for the scale-invariant density perturbations in the spectral index. The Inflationary Paradigm, which refers to a period of quasi-de Sitter inflation dominated by dark energy, being modelled as a scalar field with a sufficiently strong frictional term producing ``slow-roll inflation" solves the aforementioned problems. The solution to the Horizon and Flatness Problems is solved simply by inflation lasting long enough, equating to about $N = 60$ for the number of e-foldings; however, slow-roll inflation is required to give the observational relation between the tensor ratio and the spectral index. 

These requirements allow for a very high amount of flexibility between different models; however, out of the many that exist, 2 of the most notable are the $\alpha$-attractor models and the Starobinsky inflation model. The Starobinsky model was one of the first and is one of the most successful inflationary models, being discovered within many newer models, such as the E-model from $\alpha$-attractors. 

Despite the success of the Inflationary Paradigm, it is still plagued by problems, most notably whether it is falsifiable itself, which has led to alternative models such as String Gas Cosmology and the Ekpyrotic scenario. These models have some promising features, but they are plagued by their own problems and specificities. Currently, inflation offers the best explanation for the problems incurred by the Hot Big Bang than these alternatives do, and the broad range of models means that as the observational bounds continue to be limited, non-conforming models may be removed from contention.
