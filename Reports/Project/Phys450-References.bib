  abstract = {We propose a class of models in which the \$η\$-problem of supersymmetric hybrid inflation is resolved using a Heisenberg symmetry, where the associated modulus field is stabilized and made heavy with the help of the large vacuum energy during inflation without any fine-tuning. The proposed class of models is well motivated both from string theory considerations, since it includes the commonly encountered case of no-scale supergravity Kaehler potential, and from the perspective of particle physics since a natural candidate for the inflaton in this class of models is the right-handed sneutrino which is massless during the inflationary epoch, and subsequently acquires a large mass at the end of inflation. We study a specific example motivated by sneutrino hybrid inflation with no-scale supergravity in some detail, and show that the spectral index may lie within the latest WMAP range, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small.},

Next, I describe how inflation transforms microscopic quantum fluctuations into macroscopic seeds for cosmological structure formation. I present in full detail the famous calculation for the primordial spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations. I then define the inverse problem of extracting information on the inflationary era from observations of cosmic microwave background fluctuations. The current observational evidence for inflation and opportunities for future tests of inflation are discussed.

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$Λ\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$Λ\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$Ω\_c h\textasciicircum 2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$Ω\_b h\textasciicircum 2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$τ= 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100θ\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$Λ\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$Ω\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$σ\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$Λ\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_ν{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$Λ\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,σ\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$Λ\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {The eta problem is one of the most significant obstacles to building a successful inflationary model in string theory. Planck mass suppressed corrections to the inflaton potential generally lead to inflaton masses of order the Hubble scale and generate contributions of order unity to the eta slow roll parameter rendering prolonged slow roll inflation impossible. We demonstrate the severity of this problem in the context of brane anti-brane inflation in a warped throat of a Calabi-Yau flux compactification with all phenomenologically dangerous moduli stabilized. Using exact numerical solutions we show that the eta problem can be avoided in scenarios where the inflaton is non-minimally coupled to gravity and has Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) kinetic term. We show that the resulting cosmic microwave background (CMB) observables such as measures of non-gaussianites can, in principle, serve as a probe of scalar-gravity couplings.},

These problems would disappear if, in its early history, the universe supercooled to temperatures 28 or more orders of magnitude below the critical temperature for some phase transition. A huge expansion factor would then result from a period of exponential growth, and the entropy of the universe would be multiplied by a huge factor when the latent heat is released. Such a scenario is completely natural in the context of grand unified models of elementary-particle interactions. In such models, the supercooling is also relevant to the problem of monopole suppression. Unfortunately, the scenario seems to lead to some unacceptable consequences, so modifications must be sought.},

The propagation and absorption of gravitational radiation is also investigated in this approximation.

  abstract = {The concept of attractors, well-known in classical mechanics, proved to be very productive in supergravity, in the theory of black holes and inflationary cosmology. We start with attractors in supersymmetric black holes and discuss also non-BPS black hole attractors. Recently the non-BPS case helped to explain, via enhanced dualitiy symmetry, mysterious cancellation of ultraviolet divergences in 82 Feynman diagrams in 4-loop superamplitude in \$N=5\$ supergravity. We discuss the implications of these results for the possibility of the all-loop finiteness of \$N {$>$} 4\$ 4D supergravities. We continue with the description of inflationary \$α\$-attractors. This large class of inflationary models gives predictions that are stable with respect to even very significant modifications of inflationary potentials. These predictions match all presently available CMB-related cosmological data. These models provide targets for the future satellite mission LiteBIRD, which will attempt to detect primordial gravitational waves. We describe some of the recent advanced versions of cosmological attractors which have a beautiful fractal landscape structure.

This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.},

In the model the Kähler potential has a Nambu-Goldstone-like shift symmetry of the inflaton chiral multiplet which ensures the flatness of the inflaton potential beyond the Planck scale. We show that the chaotic inflation naturally takes place by introducing a small breaking term of the shift symmetry in the superpotential. This may open a new branch of model building for inflationary universe in the framework of supergravity.},

  abstract = {We extend the matter bounce scenario to a more general theory in which the background dynamics and cosmological perturbations are generated by a \$k\$-essence scalar field with an arbitrary sound speed. When the sound speed is small, the curvature perturbation is enhanced, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is excessively large in the original model, can be sufficiently suppressed to be consistent with observational bounds. Then, we study the primordial three-point correlation function generated during the matter-dominated contraction stage and find that it only depends on the sound speed parameter. Similar to the canonical case, the shape of the bispectrum is mainly dominated by a local form, though for some specific sound speed values a new shape emerges and the scaling behaviour changes. Meanwhile, a small sound speed also results in a large amplitude of non-Gaussianities, which is disfavored by current observations. As a result, it does not seem possible to suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio without amplifying the production of non-Gaussianities beyond current observational constraints (and vice versa). This suggests an extension of the previously conjectured no-go theorem in single field nonsingular matter bounce cosmologies, which rules out a large class of models. However, the non-Gaussianity results remain as a distinguishable signature of matter bounce cosmology and have the potential to be detected by observations in the near future.},

  abstract = {F-term hybrid inflation models in the context of supergravity generically have corrections to the inflaton mass squared of the order of H\textasciicircum\{2\} (the η-problem). In addition they have a problem with large deviations of the spectrum of density perturbations from scale-invariance due to non-renormalizable corrections to the superpotential. Here we show that an increase of the expansion rate at large energy densities relative to that in conventional d=4 cosmology, as suggested by the single brane Randall-Sundrum scenario with an uncompactified extra dimension, can naturally solve the ηproblem. This requires that the d=5 Planck mass satisfies M\_\{5\} {$<$} 10\textasciicircum\{16\} GeV. In addition, the scale-invariance of the density perturbation spectrum can be generally protected from Planck-suppressed superpotential corrections if M\_\{5\} {$<$} 10\textasciicircum\{10\} \textbackslash GeV},

We argue that a detection of the cosmic graviton background (CGB), the relic radiation from gravitons decoupling around Planck time, would rule out the inflationary paradigm, as realistic inflationary models would dilute the CGB to an unobservable level. The CGB contribution to the effective number of relativistic species, ΔN eff,g ≈ 0.054, is well within the reach of next-generation cosmological probes. We argue that detecting the high-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background associated to the CGB will be challenging but potentially feasible.
